# Tetcore - Token Curated Registries

An implementation of (a subset of) [Token Curated Registries](https://medium.com/@ilovebagels/token-curated-registries-1-0-61a232f8dac7) (TCR) as a [Parity Substrate](https://www.parity.io/substrate/) runtime. Built using [substrate-node-template](https://github.com/paritytech/substrate/tree/master/node-template) codebase.

The TCR runtime is implemented as a multi-module runtime with following two modules.

1. **tcr.rs** - The main module with all curation and initialization functions. The module implements a simple-TCR as described and implemented [here](https://github.com/gautamdhameja/simple-tcr). The full TCR functionality in not implemented but only basic curation functions are.
2. **token.rs** - Implementation of the modified ERC20 interface to serve as the native token for the TCR module. There are some additional functions implemented for locking and unlocking of tokens.

## Usage

### Step 0

If you are new to [Substrate](https://www.parity.io/substrate/), please go through the [getting started tutorial](https://substrate.dev/docs/en/tutorials/creating-your-first-substrate-chain) first. It will give you a sense of how the code is structured in a `substrate-node-template` and how to get it up and running.

This will also ensure that you have Rust and Substrate installed on your system.

### Step 1

Clone this repository. Inside the directory where you have cloned, run the following commands,

* To build the rust code and the node:

```bash
cargo build --release
```

* To start the node:

```bash
./target/release/substrate-tcr --dev
```

A local Substrate node with the TCR runtime should be up and running at `localhost:9944`.

### Step 2 (UI)

You can either use the [Substrate-TCR-UI](https://github.com/parity-samples/substrate-tcr-ui) to connect with this runtime or you can try it out using the [Polkadot Apps UI](https://polkadot.js.org/apps/).

To try it with the [Polkadot Apps UI](https://polkadot.js.org/apps/), follow the following steps,

* Once the local node is running, open the following in your browser,

```
https://polkadot.js.org/apps/
```

* Go to the settings page and select `Local Node` in the `remote node/endpoint to connect to` input. Click `Save & Reload`.

For further instructions on using the runtime with the Polkadot Apps UI, please see this [wiki page](https://github.com/substrate-developer-hub/substrate-tcr/wiki/How-to-test-the-Substrate-TCR-runtime-using-Polkadot-Apps-Portal) in this repository.
